# `LaunchDarklyProvider` Component

The `LaunchDarklyProvider` is a React component that is designed to work with the LaunchDarkly feature flag management system. It initializes the LaunchDarkly client, retrieves feature flags, and provides them to its child components via a context. The component also handles cleanup when it's unmounted.

## Using `LaunchDarklyProvider` Component

To integrate the `LaunchDarklyProvider` component into your React application, follow these steps:

### 1. Import Dependencies

First, make sure you've imported the necessary dependencies and custom modules in your React file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { LaunchDarklyProvider } from 'launchdarkly-context-provider'
```

### 2. Define User Context and Feature Flags

Define the user context and initial feature flags you want to use within your application. The user context typically includes a unique user key:

```javascript
const userContext = {
  key: 'unique_user_key',
  // Add other user context properties as needed
};

const initialFeatureFlags = {
  featureFlag1: false,
  featureFlag2: true,
  // Add other feature flags as needed
};
```

### 3. Wrap Your Application with `LaunchDarklyProvider`

Wrap your application or a specific part of it with the `LaunchDarklyProvider`. Provide the required props:

- `launchDarklyClientSideId`: Your LaunchDarkly client-side ID.
- `launchDarklyUserContext`: The user context you defined in step 2.
- `launchDarklyFeatureFlags`: The initial feature flags you defined in step 2.

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <LaunchDarklyProvider
      launchDarklyClientSideId="YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID"
      launchDarklyUserContext={userContext}
      launchDarklyFeatureFlags={initialFeatureFlags}
    >
      {/* Your application components go here */}
    </LaunchDarklyProvider>
  );
}
```

### 4. Access Feature Flags in Your Components

Within your application components, you can access the feature flags provided by the `LaunchDarklyProvider` by using the `useLaunchDarkly` hook.

First, import the `useLaunchDarkly` hook:

```javascript
import { useLaunchDarkly } from 'launchdarkly-context-provider'
```

Then, use the `useLaunchDarkly` hook to access the feature flags:

```javascript
function MyFeatureComponent() {
  const featureFlags = useLaunchDarkly();

  // Access individual feature flags as needed
  const isFeatureFlag1Enabled = featureFlags.featureFlag1;
  const isFeatureFlag2Enabled = featureFlags.featureFlag2;

  // Render your component based on feature flag values
  // ...
}
```

Now your components can make decisions and render content based on the state of your feature flags.
